why bother adding in an else{ if it'll BREAK when it hits that? xD
SO glad I wrote that function, lol.
or rather, isIgnored(nick,channel)
that at least works :P

MG Didn't do anything.
After hanging out in #archives, you'd think so.l
sigh, turns out everyone knows how I should act?
You called my name why?
I'll ban him from the server if he ends up earning a ban for harassment here and continues it there.
But I think he's learned his lesson.
I do
I did. You know the expectations when it comes to other people, correct?
I wouldn't bother getting into it. It's really not worth the time of day.

They did it to avoid the evil scum.

I read that as "condimental statement"
Atleast I didn't read it as "condom statement"

<flip> you, Jetty.
You know it does ban after like four of those right?
bot fight!
Spammy.
Fine. I can just code it in mIRC so that Jetty can't ping me, because coding it is more fun than just doing it through the normal mIRC
roullete is even more spammy than 8ball is
what no one wants to play with me?
wooh!
I hate madagascar...

you do /nick before you connect
that shouldn't be the focus right now.
That isn't necessarily true.
Mg, who cares how many times
Hrm... G, how do you get to that window that lets you change your Primary Nick, and your Secondary Nick?
Thank you.
Damn it! I swear I would go, I want to go!So why can't I? It doesn't make sense!

We can't speak too loud.
"depressed" or "upset" would be closer
Uh...
Was that silence?
Also. Hi, [name].
I failed to get the 8ball in the corner pocket :P
hey [name].
I have news
I heard this yesterday
it can now be used from another channel
Samis: Involuntary Euthanasia 24%, Cancer 27%, Disappearance 41%.
Disappeaence doesnt happen to foreign citizens
What if he were to get Cancer?
If that happened we would send him home immediately.
My final question, what about heart disease?
and you could likely deal with it better.
I just came back to irc and saw 'Heart disease'
he has very low bullying levels.
why do you think this is so?
also, Blah now requires us to buy 8ball
You get 1 point each time you speak
You have a long way to go.
iI wish i could spam to get the points, but that would break a rule.
Happeh burfday!!
G , link me again.
I pinged him first
... lol
